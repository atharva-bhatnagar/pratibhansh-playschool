        <p>
          We are started this Play School in the memory of our late beloved
          mother Pratibha Srivastava who always inspired us and she will always.
          Our mother was an inspiring soul, always there for all who came to her
          with their troubles. To the world, you were one person but for us you
          are the entire world. We are initiating this Play School with all your
          love and blessings. It is just the effort to give you a small tribute
          by opening this Pratibhash Play School. We love you so much Max. It is
          just the beginning Maa, One day we will make you proud. We will take
          care children like our mother did. This play school is completely
          dedicated to our mother's vision.
        </p>
