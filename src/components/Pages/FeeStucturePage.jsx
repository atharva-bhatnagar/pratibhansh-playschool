      <p>
        Welcome to Pratibhansh Play School, where we provide a nurturing and
        stimulating environment for children to learn and grow. We understand
        that choosing a play school for your child is an important decision, and
        we strive to make the process as transparent and easy as possible. Here
        is a breakdown of our fee structure: Admission Fee: This is a one-time
        fee charged at the time of admission. It covers administrative expenses
        such as paperwork, registration, and processing. The admission fee is
        non-refundable. Tuition Fee: This is the fee charged for the academic
        program and other activities offered by the play school. It is usually
        charged on a monthly or quarterly basis. The tuition fee may vary
        depending on the program, age group, and duration of the program.
        Material Fee: This is the fee charged for the materials used in the
        various activities offered by the play school, such as art supplies,
        books, and toys. The material fee may be charged separately or included
        in the tuition fee. Transportation Fee: This is the fee charged for
        transportation services provided by the play school. It may be optional
        or mandatory depending on the distance and location of the play school
        and the child's residence. Late Fee: This is the fee charged for late
        payment of tuition or other fees. The late fee may be charged as a
        percentage of the overdue amount or as a fixed amount. At Pratibhansh
        Play School, we understand the importance of affordable and flexible fee
        structures. We offer various payment plans and discounts for siblings
        and advance payment. We also provide detailed invoices and receipts for
        all fees charged. If you have any questions or concerns about our fee
        structure, please do not hesitate to contact us
